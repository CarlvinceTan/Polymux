/**
 * The edge fade the settings rails carry, as one behaviour every scrollable
 * column can share: solid where the content ends, faded where it runs on, and
 * the fade at an edge gone the moment the list is scrolled hard against it.
 *
 * The element supplies the mask through the `scroll-fade` class in the global
 * stylesheet; this only keeps `at-top`/`at-bottom` honest. Measurements are
 * re-taken on scroll, on a resize of the column, and on any change to what is
 * inside it, so a filtered list or a panel that swapped its contents never
 * leaves a fade over an edge that no longer scrolls.
