“Personal AI assistant” now describes several very different products. Some begin with a terminal, some with a messaging gateway, and others with a library of your notes. Polymux begins with the desktop workspace itself.

That difference matters more than a checklist. It determines what the assistant can see, how much setup it needs, and whether using it feels like opening another chatbot or working inside one connected environment.

This comparison looks at four open-source approaches: **Polymux**, **Hermes Agent**, **OpenClaw**, and **Khoj**. It is based on their published documentation as of August 2026, not a benchmark or a claim that one product is best at everything.

## The short version

| Product | Starting point | Strongest fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Polymux** | A desktop workspace joining chat, messages, email, files, browser tabs, tasks, and models | Someone who wants an assistant to feel like one everyday app |
| **Hermes Agent** | An extensible agent runtime spanning terminal, desktop, messaging, and IDEs | A power user who wants deep automation, skills, memory, and agent orchestration |
| **OpenClaw** | A self-hosted gateway between chat apps and AI agents | Someone who wants an always-available assistant they can message from anywhere |
| **Khoj** | A personal knowledge and search assistant for your own documents | Someone whose main goal is asking questions across notes, PDFs, and saved knowledge |

## Polymux: workspace-first

Polymux is built around a simple idea: the assistant should live beside the things you already work with, not in a separate chat box.

Its desktop app brings together a **Hub** for messages and email, a **Drive** for local and cloud files, an in-app and external **Browser**, scheduled work, durable memory, and chat-scoped tasks. You can use hosted or local models, keep the bundled Polymux Agent, or connect another agent through the open Agent Client Protocol.

The advantage is coherence. A conversation, an email, a file, and a browser page can all remain visible parts of the same workspace. Polymux is trying to reduce the amount of assembly required before an assistant becomes useful day to day.

The trade-off is maturity and surface area. Polymux is still early, desktop-only, and currently best supported on macOS. It is also intentionally a full application rather than a small agent library you drop into an existing stack.

## Hermes Agent: agent-first

[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/overview/) is the broadest agent framework in this group. Its official feature set includes persistent memory, reusable skills, checkpoints, cron tasks, subagent delegation, browser automation, voice, MCP connections, provider routing, plugins, and IDE integration.

Hermes can run in a terminal, desktop app, messaging platform, or compatible editor. That makes it a strong choice if the agent itself is the product you want to configure and extend. Its skills and plugin systems are especially attractive for repeatable technical workflows.

Compared with Polymux, Hermes puts more emphasis on the runtime and its autonomy. Polymux puts more emphasis on the surrounding workspace: the visible chats, inboxes, files, browser pages, and task state that the agent is working across.

Choose Hermes when you want a powerful, configurable agent framework. Choose Polymux when you want that intelligence presented through one integrated desktop environment.

## OpenClaw: channel-first

[OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/) describes itself as a self-hosted gateway connecting chat apps to AI coding agents. One gateway can serve channels such as Discord, iMessage, Signal, Slack, Telegram, and WhatsApp, with sessions, routing, memory, a web control UI, and mobile nodes.

Its central promise is availability. You run the gateway on your own machine or server, then reach the assistant from the messaging apps already in your pocket. For a developer or self-hoster, that is a compelling shape: one durable service, many ways in.

Polymux also connects communication services, but the product centre is different. OpenClaw makes your existing chat apps the interface. Polymux collects those conversations into its own Hub and places them beside Drive, Browser, Tasks, and the primary assistant chat.

Choose OpenClaw when remote access and channel routing are the priority. Choose Polymux when you want a dedicated visual workspace that brings those channels together with the rest of your computer work.

## Khoj: knowledge-first

[Khoj](https://docs.khoj.dev/) calls itself an open-source personal AI and “second brain.” It can answer questions using files you share, search notes and documents with natural language, and work with sources including PDFs, Markdown, plaintext, org-mode, and Notion. It is available through the web, a desktop app, Obsidian, and Emacs, and can be used through Khoj Cloud or self-hosted.

Khoj is the clearest fit when your personal knowledge base is the centre of the experience. If the core job is finding an idea buried across years of notes or chatting with a document library, its focus is easy to understand.

Polymux’s Drive and memory overlap with part of that territory, but Polymux is broader and more operational. It is designed to work across live conversations, files, webpages, and tasks, rather than primarily serving as a retrieval layer over a personal corpus.

Choose Khoj when your notes are the product. Choose Polymux when files are one part of a wider working environment.

## What actually separates them

The most useful comparison is not “which one has memory?” All four projects treat context and personalisation as important. The better questions are:

### Where do you want to spend your time?

- In one desktop workspace: **Polymux**
- In a configurable agent runtime: **Hermes Agent**
- In your existing messaging apps: **OpenClaw**
- In your personal knowledge base: **Khoj**

### How much do you want to assemble yourself?

Hermes and OpenClaw reward configuration. Their flexibility is part of the appeal. Khoj offers both a hosted path and private self-hosting. Polymux aims to make the common workspace useful after a normal desktop install, while leaving model, MCP, skills, and agent choices open for people who want them.

### What should remain visible while the assistant works?

This is where Polymux is most opinionated. An assistant should not only return an answer. It should let you see the conversation it found, the file it opened, the page it used, and the task it delegated—without forcing everything through a stream of chat messages.

## Why we are building Polymux

Hermes, OpenClaw, and Khoj each make a strong case for their centre of gravity. Polymux is not trying to erase those distinctions or win a feature-count contest.

We are building Polymux because we think a personal assistant needs a home: a calm, understandable place where communication, files, browsing, models, and ongoing work meet. The agent matters, but so does the environment around it.
